 v 1.11

# RimStory

Since starting my first colony in Rimworld I thought the game should be about the Story.
I remember well when my first colonist die, first marriage in colony, raids... i remember how one guy, who barely knew about medicine, rescued all his palls.

I really, really miss those times.

That's why I made RimStory.

RimStory logs all important events of life in a colony life for example: deaths, marriages, epic battles and failures as well.

The colonists will organize anniversary parties, raise their glasses for their fallen comrades on the day they have died and so on!

#### FAQ:

# Q: Is RimStory compatible with X mod?
A: Yes! :) RimStory works with any mod. But, when you want to use RimStory with Psychology I advice to disable funerals in my mod (to not get doubled funerals)

It's working with Days Matter too, but I advice to disable events in my mod or just use RimStory OR Days Matter :)

# Q: Can you translate RimStory to X language?
A: I would love to! But I know only Polish and English (ok... half English!). But... if you do have translation, just send me the files and I will implement your language ASAP :)

# Q: Can I propose X/Y/Z?
A: Yes!

# Q: Does RimStory affects performance?
A: NO! Not at ALL!
